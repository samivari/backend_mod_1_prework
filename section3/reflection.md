## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Two points that really resonated with me was the idea of using SMART goals and the growth mindset allows you to think of never giving up and trying to asses the problem in a different approach.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I use SMART goals semi-consistently, after reading the article, I want to use SMART goals more consistently during my time at Turing
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
Pet_store = {dog food bags: 20, pet shampoo bottles: 30, birds for adoption: 4}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states.value[1]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys
states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A head count for a party, so you can have a number on gender and whos bringing food

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Just a better understanding on them but im sure i'll get more exposure this coming mod
